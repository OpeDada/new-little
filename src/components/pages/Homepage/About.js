      <p className="">
        Little Lemon opened in 1995 by two Italian brothers, Adrian and Mario.
        Despite the city's diversity, the two brothers recognized the lack of
        Mediterranean cuisine in Chicago, and were inspired to bring the flavors
        of their hometown in Italy to the people of Chicago. The two brothers
        continue to oversee the Little Lemon restaurant, nearly thirty years
        later.
